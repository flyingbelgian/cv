    <p>I'm a trained and highly experienced Instrument Flight Procedure Design specialist, with a thorough understanding
      of all ICAO regulations related to the field of Instrument Flight Procedures, Aeronautical Information and Aviation
      Safety. My experience as a pilot as well as an air traffic controller, combined with the pragmatic approach
      cultivated through my years in the military, and the time spent on several international regulatory panels
      provide me with unique insight in the practical implications as well as the theory involved with IFPD.</p>
    <p>My passion for open-source software and freedom of choice have driven me to start learning programming. My intention
      is to one day be able to create IFPD software that can run on multiple OS, allowing people in the field of IFPD to
      finally break free from the confines of Windows based software. The ability to draw relatively simple geometry and
      perform the rudimentory maths required for IFPD work should not require hi-powered industrial computers and sophisticated
      CAD software. The historical reliance on CAD software to do IFPD work is no longer justified: in the current world where
      the focus is on interoperability and obstacle datasets and terrain data are increasingly detailed and complex it makes
      far more sense to perform IFPD work in a GIS environment where obstacle and terrain data is native.</p>
